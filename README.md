# react-tui

This project is a reactjs component library based on [TuiCss](https://github.com/vinibiavatti1/TuiCss).

I've basically written this out of my own interest.

There were some additions made for accessibility reasons, to make the focus states a little better, which actually didn't exist for radio and checkbox components. I'm no designer so appreciate feedback on those.

I have many things I want to do with this, I will use this in my own project soon.

If you wish to contribute, that's good. If you have feature requests please raise issues and I will respond as time for hobby projects permits.
